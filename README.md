# üçΩÔ∏è GourmetAI ‚Äì Food Image Classification Optimization

Welcome to the repository for the **optimization of a food image classification neural network** developed for **GourmetAI Inc.**, a leading company in food tech innovation. This project focuses on boosting the **accuracy**, **efficiency**, and **generalization** of a deep learning model designed to recognize and categorize food images.

## üöÄ Project Overview

GourmetAI is tackling the challenge of improving food image recognition systems to better serve its customers and streamline operations. Using advanced deep learning strategies, we aim to build a robust model that delivers fast and reliable classification results.

### üí° Why It Matters

- **Better User Experience**: High-accuracy predictions enhance apps and services for end-users.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated classification reduces manual intervention and processing time.
- **Tech Leadership**: Cutting-edge solutions solidify GourmetAI‚Äôs position as a market innovator.

## üß† Techniques Used

- **Data Augmentation**: Applied a variety of image augmentation strategies (e.g., rotation, flipping, color jitter) to increase dataset diversity and reduce overfitting.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraged pre-trained CNN architectures to accelerate training and improve baseline accuracy.
- **Fine Tuning**: Carefully tuned the final classifier layers and selectively unfroze parts of the backbone to adapt the model to the food domain.
- **Regularization**: Included dropout, early stopping, and weight decay to mitigate overfitting.
- **Validation Strategies**: Employed validation sets and K-fold cross-validation (when needed) for better hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation.

## üß™ Project Pipeline

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Splitting into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Applying augmentations to training data only.
2. **Model Selection**
   - Choosing architecture(s) based on performance tradeoffs.
   - Initial benchmarking with frozen weights.
3. **Training & Optimization**
   - Fine-tuning with selected hyperparameters.
   - Iterative validation and model adjustments.
4. **Evaluation**
   - Final test set evaluation.
   - Reporting accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Challenges

- **Dataset Imbalance**: Addressed with weighted loss functions and targeted augmentations.
- **Overfitting**: Managed via regularization techniques and careful validation.
- **Model Generalization**: Ensured through rigorous testing on unseen data.

## üìà Outcomes & Benefits

The optimized model demonstrates strong generalization performance and faster inference times, contributing directly to improved user satisfaction and business process automation.
